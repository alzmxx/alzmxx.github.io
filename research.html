<h2>Synergizing Optimal Control and Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Systems</h2>
<p>We explore the integration of optimal control theory and reinforcement learning algorithms to enhance autonomous systems. By combining the precision of optimal control with the adaptability of reinforcement learning, this research aims to create more robust and efficient autonomous technologies capable of navigating complex environments. Through this synergistic approach, the study envisions advancing autonomy, leading to safer and more intelligent systems across various industries.
</p>
<h2>Enhancing Traffic Efficiency and Resilience  through Multi-Agent Cooperation</h2>
<p>We investigate collaborative strategies among diverse entities within transportation networks. Through principles from reinforcement learning and game theory, it explores how agents such as vehicles and infrastructure can cooperate to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve sustainability. This research envisions a future where cooperation enhances mobility for all stakeholders.
</p>
<h2>Generative AI for Modeling and Optimization in dynamic Networks</h2>
<p>We explore the application of Large Language Model (LLM) and generative AI techniques to refine transportation systems. By leveraging advanced AI capabilities, such as natural language processing and pattern recognition, the research aims to optimize route planning, traffic management, and infrastructure design. Through data-driven insights and computational optimization, this interdisciplinary approach promises to revolutionize transportation networks, improving efficiency and reducing congestion.
</p>
<h2>Traffic Flow Modeling with Connected and Automated Vehicles</h2>
<p>We delves into integrating connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) into modern transportation systems using updated partial differential equations (PDE) models. This study aims to optimize traffic networks by understanding CAV dynamics, envisioning seamless, efficient, and safe traffic flows. By scrutinizing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, it promises insights crucial for designing intelligent transportation systems to alleviate congestion and enhance mobility.
